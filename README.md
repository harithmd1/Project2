# Project2 / Machine Learning Momentum Trading


## Sources
- ALPACA API for MSFT


## Data
- Base Tick info plus added indexes like MACD, RSI, ADX, etc.


## Code
1. Momentum Trading signal to buy or sell through MACD/ADX


2.  Neural Network Supervised Machine Learning
- X= all columns in our data (indicators) frame except y
- y= signal


3. Compare Neural Network accuracy to original method of signal generation.

4. Create two alternative neural networks to modify accuracy.
   
6. compare features weights for the best neural network


## Analysis and visualization
- Plot the MACD/ADX signals
- Plot the signals Histogram
- PLot the strategy returs compared to S&P500 returns
- Plot the neural network returs compared to original signal returns


## Participants:
Harith Alshuwaykh, Sam Muslin, Ryan Stowers, Erin O'leary.
